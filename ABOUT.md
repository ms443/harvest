# Motivation
If you look around, you'll notice that there are already countless algo-trading frameworks out there. So why do we need another one? That's because many of the existing frameworks have one or more of the following issues:
- Requires users to pay for certain features.
- The code is closed source, and cannot be modified by the community.
- The interface is complex, and the learning curve is steep.
- Only supports specific brokerages.
- Only works for specific type of assets, like cryptocurrencies. 

The goal of Harvest is therefore:
- Be free and open source.
- Allow users and dev to mod the framework as they need. 
- Keep the functionality minimal yet flexible and robust. 
- Support many popular brokerages.
- Support stocks, crypto, and options.

# Principles
The following are the core values of this project you should keep in mind, especially if you are coding a new feature or approving a big PR. 

- üòÄ Beginner friendly: Keep the interface simple and minimal, focusing on the essentials. Complicated options and configurations should be hidden away. 
- üõ†Ô∏è Modifiable: The code should be easy for developers to add new features and make modifications. 
- üìú Principle over performance: Sometimes you may have to choose between the performance of the code and following the principles. In such case, always choose the latter. 

# v0.3 Goals
- Improve the web interface.
- Provide better documentation.
- Improve framework interface.
- Stability and performance improvement.
